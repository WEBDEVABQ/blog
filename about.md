# About Jamena McInteer
### Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Jamena McInteer, a front end developer of eight years living in Albuquerque, NM. I am committed to producing magic, to over-delivering, and to sticking a smile on web and mobile users . . . speechlessness counts too.

I'm a bit of a tea snob, a health junkie, a lover of science and data, and an over-achieving life-time learner. But when I do get some spare time, I enjoy doing nothing with my husband, family, and our adopted cat, Evan.
